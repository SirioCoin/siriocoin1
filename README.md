SirioCoin is a new lending method based on Ethereum Blockchain

Why choose us? Our Multi-Contracts adds privileges and advantages for the first token holders.
Investing in SirioCoin you will have free tokens of SirioCoin II and SirioCoin III. You will also have
the possibility to buy SirioCoin II directly and obtain SirioCoin III. Each contract will have its own
specific Lending and Referral program.

Interesting, isn’t it?


How does it work

This is the graph of tokens distribution through the various contracts.
As you can see, who has 1 SirioCoin, will automatically receive 0.50
of SirioCoin II and 0.50 of SirioCoin III.
In the same way, those who have only SirioCoin II have 0.25 of SirioCoin III.
The MultiContracts will start about 6 months apart from each other



The Lending system

Each Contract has its own lending system:
the systems are cumulative and depends on which SirioCoin you own. 
Honest and fair: there are not bogus percentages to mislead you.
These are made to last over time and increase as the token values increase.
Just imagine how much it will be worth the first contract that holds the privileges on others.



There is also a different type of referral for each contract.
This system is also cumulative as a percentage of the various contracts.
It will also be increased with bonuses compared to the position in the community,
how much you own, how long you are inside the system and of course how many
people have registered through your link.



We are a team who think they have a good and above all a solid idea, made
to renew over time and therefore to last over time, with honest percentages
and verifiable coverage.

We think it is useless to tell you that it is still a system of lending with its risks,
and therefore it is important, before investing, to understand what you are doing.
We believe you will agree with us that it is a very valid and interesting idea.

Registrations and ICO referral program will start on 10 February 2018 on our website
you will find whitepaper, roadmap, all the FAQ and contacts where you can write us
your every doubt, we will be happy to answer you.
